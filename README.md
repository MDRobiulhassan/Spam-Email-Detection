# Spam-Email-Detection
## Project Overview

The **Spam Email Detection Using AI** project aims to build a machine learning-based model that can classify emails as either **Spam** or **Not Spam**. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and vectorize the email content, followed by training a machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is deployed with a user-friendly interface using **Gradio**, allowing users to input email content and get real-time predictions.

The project includes:
- Text preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Extra Trees for classification.
- A Gradio interface for easy interaction, enabling users to test the model on sample emails.
- Future enhancements to improve accuracy and expand the model's capabilities.

The goal is to create an efficient, easy-to-use spam email detector that can be deployed in real-time environments.
